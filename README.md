If you want to run this on your own computer and don't know how for some reason
Install python if it's not already installed (https://python.org/downloads) (INSTALL PYTHON 3 AND UP)
Then just go in mac terminal, windows powershell, or any linux terminal of your choice and type python3 and then the path to the file e.g python3 /home/YOURNAME/Downloads/PythonCalculator.py/ and it should work (linux filesystem example)
